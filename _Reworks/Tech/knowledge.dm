/*

alright so we have shit like this esssentially
            Randomly pick a sub type until u have them all
        -> weapons
        -> armor
Forge   -> weighted clothes     -> Repair (need atleast 3 in forging) -> other paths
        -> smelting
        -> lock smithing

but i think we can do something like

Medicine
Repair                                      -> light alloys
                                                    -> shock absorbers (armor + Repair)             Molecular Tec (advanced + shock)
                    -> Weapons -> Repair    ->
Forge -> Smelting   -> Weighted Clothing - > Armor -> Engineering -> Modular WEaponry (weapons + Engineering)
                                                    -> Advanced Plating (armor + repair)
                    -> LockSmithing

engineering - > Hazard Suits (Medicine + Engineering)
            - > Force Shielding (Shock Absorbers + Engineering)
            - > Power Generators (Molecular Technology + Engineering)    - > Jet Propulstion (Light Alloys + Power Generators) - > Cyber Engineering
Cyber Engineering (Jet Propulsion)  -> Cyber Augmentations (Cyber Engineering)
                                    -> Neuron Manipulation (Cyber Engineering) -> War Crimes (Neuron Manipulation + Cyber Augmentations) -> Singularity (War Crimes)



Cyber augments give base stat boons ( should b capped)
Neuron Manipulation give the modules
War Crimes give the punishment shit

Singularity is shit like ripper, overdrive, etc

Medicine -> MedKits, Fast Acting Medicine
MedKits -> Anesthetics          Enhancers (automated + anesthetics)
Fast Actig -> Automed dispensers
